# Shutdown
 An executable I made to mess around with compiling code. Runs a loading message in the command line then shuts down the PC.
If running, please make sure to close and save all things that need saving prior to running. 

I mainly made this just to mess around with compilers like cython and py2exe. This is pretty much a little test I made and it shuts down the PC within 3 seconds after running due to a time sleep there.
